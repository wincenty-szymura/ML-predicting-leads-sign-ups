    "*Age* max value of 201 is unrealistically high. It can be also seen that it is followed by a number of smaller but still urealistic values. With the available knowledge it is hard to say how those high values appeared there and what the actual *Age* values are for those leads. Therefore, it was deemed suboptimal to try to substitute the high values with *Age* median or mode, or setting all values above certain threshold to that threshold (however, all these approaches have been tried and were not found to improve the model's performance). Keeping the values was also decided againts, as modelling sign-up probability for people of unreaslistic age makes little sense. Therefore, it was decided that such applications are best disregarded if they do not constitute too big a fraction of the entire dataset. "

However, they are all calculated using assigned predicted labels and hence depend on and can be manipulated by the assignment threshold. The problem at hand focuses on probabilities and hence a more suited metric is the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), also known as average precision. For this setup it is also superior to another metric working with predicted probabilities, ROC-AUC, as it better measures the ability of the model to find positives faster (https://towardsdatascience.com/imbalanced-data-stop-using-roc-auc-and-use-auprc-instead-46af4910a494), which is what the model is after."

Regarding the value itself, the baseline for AUPRC score is the fraction of the positives in the dataset which in this case is around 28.3%. Whether the model is a good or a bad one is hard to state given how difficult to define such descriptions are when it comes to regression models, as well as a clear fact that this is by no means state-of-the-art. It is possible that better performance can be achieved using a different algorithm. More importantly, an algorithm is only as good as the data it is fed and obtaining features more relevant to the questions asked would be the first step to improve it. However, with average precision score of 44.6% the model is not irrelevant and will be used to make predictions the assignment asks to make."
